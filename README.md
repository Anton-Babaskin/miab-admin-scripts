👋 Hi, I’m Anton Babaskin (@z3r0-gr4v1tY)  
🧠 DevOps / Infrastructure Architect focused on Linux-first environments, mail systems, and automation.  
🌍 I manage distributed systems for trading/enterprise teams — and build tools to make admin life easier.

# 🛠️ Mail-in-a-Box Admin Scripts

A personal collection of Bash scripts I use to streamline, secure, and monitor **Mail-in-a-Box (MIAB)** servers in production.  
Everything here is field-tested in real-world infrastructure (multi-domain, Postgrey, SFTP/WebDAV backups, Telegram alerts).

> 🧰 All scripts were written from scratch and adapted to suit the needs of live mail infrastructure across several companies.
